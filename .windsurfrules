1. Never delete existing code, keep current structure and flow, make only necessary additions
2. Modify only requested parts, make minimal targeted updates, add code without breaking existing features
3. Analyze code first, explain understanding, show changes before applying
4. Keep same file organization, maintain existing functions, don't reorganize codebase
